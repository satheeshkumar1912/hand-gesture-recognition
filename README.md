Volume Control using Hand Gestures:
This project is a hand gesture-based volume control system that leverages computer vision to adjust volume levels without physical touch. The solution uses hand tracking and gesture recognition to detect specific movements, translating them into volume changes for a seamless, intuitive experience.

Features:
1. Gesture Recognition: Recognizes hand gestures to increase, decrease, or mute volume.
2. Real-Time Tracking: Provides instant response to hand movements, ensuring smooth volume control.
3. Touchless Interface: Eliminates the need for physical buttons, offering a hands-free interaction.

Tech Stack:
1. Python for the core logic and integrations.
2. OpenCV for real-time video capture and hand tracking.
3. MediaPipe for precise hand gesture recognition.

How It Works:
1. The camera captures hand movements.
2. OpenCV and MediaPipe process the video stream to detect gestures.
3. Detected gestures are mapped to specific volume control actions.
